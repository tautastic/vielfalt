[{"content":"Who we are The Vielfalt AG We are students from various grades and are committed as the VIELFALT-AG to ensure that every person at our school (of course also outside) feels accepted, appreciated and comfortable. No matter how big or small, no matter what religion, origin, hair or skin color, sexuality or identity someone has - everyone has the right to freedom, love and acceptance. Our Goals We want to oppose exclusion, draw attention, encourage people to stand up for themselves and others to stand up for their friends and fellow human beings. But above all we want to clarify what \u0026ldquo;LGBTQ+\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;People of Color\u0026rdquo; actually means and why we still have to stand up for social justice at all today.\nOur current projects We organize panel discussions, conduct surveys, integrate gender education, promote training for teachers in this area, expand project weeks and provide support for students. A mailbox where you can drop any questions or suggestions hangs in the large break hall for you to use. Feel free to ask your questions (anonymously)! Teachers are also welcome to drop in questions.\nIf you want to make the world a little bit more colorful and encourage people to show their most beautiful colors, then you are at the right place. Feel free to talk to one of us, come to one of our meetings at the Interact Club, or send us an email to Vielfalt@gym-old.eu\nWe look forward to seeing YOU! 🌈\n","permalink":"https://vielfalt-ag.xyz/en/posts/about/","summary":"Get to know the Vielfalt AG 🌈","title":"About us"}]
